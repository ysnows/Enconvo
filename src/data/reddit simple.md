# Introducing Enconvo: The AI Tool/Agent Launcher for the New AI Era on MacOS

Hey ! I'm excited to share Enconvo with you - an AI launcher I built to supercharge your daily life and work. Let me tell you about our latest feature: Agent Mode.

## Agent Mode - Your AI Assistant That Just Gets Things Done

Meet Jarvis, our default agent that helps you breeze through daily tasks like:

- Scheduling meetings with Apple Calendar
- Downloading YouTube/Twitter videos
- Image and video processing
